# knn_sklearn
In this repository I have experimented with different possible K-values and distance calculation methods in KNN algorithm.
The motive was to understand how KNN works and what impact does different KNN values have on the overall model accuracy.
### distance measuring technics used-
- minkowski
- euclidean
- cosine
- manhattan
